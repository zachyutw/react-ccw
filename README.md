# Basic Requirements

-   [] There are two pages: list page and detail page. Use client side
    navigation to switch between different pages.
-   [] You can use any frontend framework you like (react, vue, angular, ...).
-   [] Use any library when you see fit. There's no point reinventing the wheel.
-   [] Do not spend too much time on this project. Spend 2-4 hours.
